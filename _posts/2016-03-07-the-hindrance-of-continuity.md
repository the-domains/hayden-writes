> "If we are born again by the Spirit of God, our devotion to Him is hindered, or even stopped, by continually asking Him to guide us here and there."
> 
> - Oswald Chambers

Reading this quote, it seems somewhat alien. Why would we not want to ask God for guidance in all that we do? However, when one meditates on it, this is a very real issue that we do not even realize we have. Asking for special guidance from God at specific times is in no way a sin and is never discouraged. But simply pleading for it constantly in everyday life could very well be a very large hindrance in our walk with Him.

One key purpose of the Christian life is to

_be like Jesus_

. Jesus was and is in a human form, just as we are. When He was on Earth, we have specific instances with Jesus praying to the Father. There is no evidence to assume that He was in constant prayer with the Father. He was a being without sin, which did allow Him to feel the presence of the Father, along with a myriad of other abilities that we will not understand, or even know until we can ask Him ourselves. But interestingly, we see Jesus praying to the Father for guidance in specifically crucial times (Lk. 22:41-44; Mk. 1:35). Jesus prayed for various things, such as for the faith of Simon (Lk. 22:32).

### Our minds are to be so saturated in Scripture, that we can feel the presence of God in our everyday decisions.

There are an incalculable amount of situations and people to pray for, including ourselves. But we are not to pray fervently every time we need to make a decision. Paul tells us in Romans 12:2, "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect." We are called to have a renewed mind. One that can make Godly decisions without having to pray every time. We must allow the Spirit of God to renew a clean spirit in us, so that our mind is so much like Christs', that we _know _that the way we are handling a situation is the way that God would want us to handle it.

This isn't to say that we are to believe that everything we do is right all the time, but it _is_ saying something very important. Our minds are to be so saturated in the Scriptures, that we can feel the presence of God in our every day decisions.

So understand that God _does _want us to come to Him and depend on Him in every day life, but He also wants us to be so drenched in His ways that, almost as a knee-jerk reaction, we react in a way that He would want us to. Let us all try to focus on becoming who God wants us to be, instead of simply asking for guidance and then doing what we were going to anyway.
