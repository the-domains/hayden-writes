## The Hindrance of Continuity

> If we are born again by the Spirit of God, our devotion to Him is hindered, or even stopped, by continually asking Him to guide us here and there. 

_- Oswald Chambers_

Reading this quote, it seems somewhat alien. Why would we not want to ask God for guidance in all that we do? But when you think about it, this is a very real issue taht we don't even realize we have. Asking for spiritual guidance at certain times from God is in no way a sin and is never discouraged. But pleading for it constantly in everyday life could very well be a large hindrance in our walk with Him.

One key purpose to the Christian life is to be like Jesus. Jesus was, and is, in human form, just as we are in this moment. When He was on earth, we see specific instances where He is praying to the Father; during crucial moments, "saying, 'Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done' (Luke 22:42, ESV)." Also, we see Him rising early in the morning to pray too, "And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed (Mark 1:35). He also prayed for the faith of Simon, "but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned again, strengthen your brothers (Luke 22:32)." There are these and other instances of Jesus praying, but we have no evidence to support His constant asking for guidance in everything He did. He was in tune with His Father. He had spent so much time not only talking, but listening to what God wanted to tell Him.

Jesus spent time pouring over the Scriptures at a young age, to learn about His Father. "Three days later, they found him in the temple courtyard. He was sitting among the teachers, listening to them, and asking them questions. His understanding and his answers stunned everyone who heard him (Luke 2:46-47)."
There is an incalcuable amount of situations and people that need prayer. But we are not to pray fervently every single time we need to make a decision. Paul tells us in Romans 12:2, "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that bytesting you may discern what is the will of God, and what is good and acceptable and perfect." We are called to have a renewed mind. One that can make godly decisions without having to pray constantly. We must allow the Spirit to renew us, so that our mind is so much like that of Christs', that we know how to respond to a situation in a godly manner as soon as it comes up.

This isn't to say that we are to believe that everything we do is right all the time, but it is saying that our minds are to be so saturated in the Scriptures, that we can feel the presence of God in our everyday decisions.
Don't spend your time in prayer constantly asking God for things and for guidance in this and that. Spend time doing nothing but listening; God will speak to a heart that is willing to listen. We were given two eyes and one mouth so that we could listen twice as much as we talk. And spend time reading the Bible; not constantly with some devotional guiding you to a certain message to take away, but read it and listen to what God is trying to tell you through His Word.
